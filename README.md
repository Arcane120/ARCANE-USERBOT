## Mandatory Vars

- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.

- If you face error like this struct error of 275 byte like this 
- So it is because you log in many devices just terminate devices and make string

    - APP_ID:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org

    - API_HASH:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org

- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.
